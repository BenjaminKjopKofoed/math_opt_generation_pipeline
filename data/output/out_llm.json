    "question": "Euing Gas produces two types of gasoline (gas 1 and gas 2) from two types of oil (oil 1 and oil 2). Each gallon of gas 1 must contain at least 50 percent oil 1, and each gallon of gas 2 must contain at least 60 percent oil 1. Each gallon of gas 1 can be sold for $12, and each gallon of gas 2 can be sold for $14. Currently, 500 gallons of oil 1 and 1,000 gallons of oil 2 are available. As many as 1,500 more gallons of oil 1 can be purchased at the prices shown in the following Table. Maximize Euing's profits (revenues - purchasing costs).\n\nTable (Purchasing prices for additional gallons of oil 1):\n| Additional Gallons of Oil 1 | Price per Gallon |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| First 500                   | $25              |\n| Next 500                    | $20              |\n| Next 500                    | $15              |",

    "question": "Maple Oil processes three types of crude oil: light oil, non-sticky oil and heavy oil. Each tank of light oil produces a net revenue of $550, each tank of non-sticky oil produces a net revenue of $750, and each tank of heavy oil produces a net revenue of $950. To process a tank of light oil, 3 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of non-sticky oil, 6 units of compound A and 2 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of heavy oil, 9 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. Currently the company has 250 units of compound A and 150 units of compound B to process. How many full or partial tanks of each oil should the company process so that net revenue is maximized?",
