Please ensure your solution follows these guidelines and addresses all specified points from both the problem description and the question to answer.
Guidelines:
1. Define the decision variables clearly based on the problem description, paying attention to whether the variables should be integer (e.g., when variables represent finite items), binary, or continuous.
2. Formulate the objective function and constraints accurately.
3. Use 'pulp.LpMaximize' or 'pulp.LpMinimize' as appropriate for the objective.
4. Implement constraints correctly, considering any special conditions:
   - If strict inequalities are present, such as \( x > y \), transform them into \( x \geq y + 1 \) for integer and binary variables, or \( x \geq y + 0.0001 \) for continuous variables.
5. Ensure all logical and physical constraints from the problem description are incorporated:
   - For tiered constraints (e.g., different values or costs at different levels), ensure correct implementation.
   - Pay attention to special conditions like non-overlapping categories, specific setups, or unique constraints.
6. Solve the problem with `problem.solve(PULP_CBC_CMD(msg=0))` to suppress the solver's log.
7. Format the output as a JSON string with the required answers, ensuring all specified outputs in the test_results are addressed.""",

Example: 
Problem (input 1): A company is organizing a team-building event and needs to assign participants to different activities. They have a total of 100 employees. Activity A requires 5 employees a team, activity B requires 3 employees a team, and activity C requires 7 employees a team. The company has a total of 100 employees available for the event. The company has a limitation on the number of teams in activity B, which cannot exceed 20. The company wants to maximize participation teams and decides to allocate different weights to each activity: activity A has a weight of 3, activity B has a weight of 2, and activity C has a weight of 4. The objective is to maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights.

Question to answer (input 2):
{{
    "The number of teams in activity A": "",
    "The number of teams in activity B": "",
    "The number of teams in activity C": "",
    "The total weighted participation": ""

Code to retrieve the answers (output):
# Import PuLP library
from pulp import *

# Define the decision variables
num_participants_A = LpVariable("NumParticipantsA", lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # number of participants in activity A
num_participants_B = LpVariable("NumParticipantsB", lowBound=0, upBound=20, cat='Integer') # number of participants in activity B
num_participants_C = LpVariable("NumParticipantsC", lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # number of participants in activity C

# Define the question as a maximum or minimum problem
problem = LpProblem("TeamBuildingEvent", LpMaximize)

# Define the objective function
objective = 3 * num_participants_A + 2 * num_participants_B + 4 * num_participants_C
problem += objective # maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights

# Define the constraints
problem += 5 * num_participants_A + 3 * num_participants_B + 7 * num_participants_C <= 100 # the total number of employees is 100

Be careful: if there are strict inequality constraints such as x>y then use x>= y +1 for integer and binary variables, use x>= 1e-4 for continuous variables instead.
Please remember to solve the problem with status = problem.solve(PULP_CBC_CMD(msg=0)) in order to suppress solver's log.
If your problem needs you to decide whether to activate some resources that has fixed costs, evaluate the opportunity to add some other variable to model this condition.
In the output all the results value must be printed as strings and all binary variables must be set to True or False (not 1 and 0 or true and false lower case).""",
